# A Simple Contact Management System

## Description

The Simple Contact Management System is a Python program designed to provide users with a straightforward way to store, manage, and organize their contact information. This system offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with their contacts efficiently. Users can add new contacts by entering their name, phone number, and email address. Furthermore, the system enables users to view their complete contact list, edit existing contact details, and remove contacts when necessary. The key feature of the program is its ability to store contacts either in memory or in a file for persistent storage, ensuring that users' contact information is accessible across sessions.
